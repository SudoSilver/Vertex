/// Optimizes a vector of instructions while preserving jump address correctness.
///
/// This function applies various optimization passes to the instruction stream,
/// such as constant folding. After each optimization, it ensures that all jump
/// addresses (Jump, JumpIfFalse) are updated to point to the correct instructions
/// in the optimized code.
///
/// # Example
/// ```
/// // Original code:
/// // 0: PushNumber(5.0)
/// // 1: PushNumber(3.0)
/// // 2: Add
/// // 3: JumpIfFalse(7)
/// // 4: PushNumber(1.0)
/// // 5: Jump(7)
/// // 6: PushNumber(0.0)
/// // 7: Halt
///
/// // After optimization (constant folding):
/// // 0: PushNumber(8.0)      // 5.0 + 3.0 folded
/// // 1: JumpIfFalse(5)        // address updated from 7 to 5
/// // 2: PushNumber(1.0)
/// // 3: Jump(5)               // address updated from 7 to 5
/// // 4: PushNumber(0.0)
/// // 5: Halt
/// ```
